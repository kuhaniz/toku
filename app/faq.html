        <h4 style="margin-bottom:20px;">Getting Started </h4>
        <a href="#" class="accordion">1. How do I install or download <strong>TOKU</strong>?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p><strong>TOKU</strong> is a mobile phone app available through the <a href="#">App Store</a> (Apple) or <a href="#">Play Store</a> (Android)
on your mobile phone. Click the links above to download the app through your mobile phone. </p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion alt">2. How do I register for an account?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Easy peasy. Download the app following Q1 and follow three simple steps to get going.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your country code and mobile phone number into your <strong>TOKU</strong> app<br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Receive an SMS on your mobile phone containing a 4-digit OTP (One Time Password) <br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter the OTP you received into the verification screen on your <strong>TOKU</strong> app</p>

<p>Voila! You’re done and ready to make your first call.</p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion">3. I am having trouble with my OTP (One Time Password)</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Your OTP is unique and only valid for 60 seconds, so be quick!</p>

<p>Requesting for a new OTP or entering the wrong OTP too many times may result in your account
being locked to protect your security for up to 24 hours. If your account is locked, <a href="contact-us.html">contact us</a>. </p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion alt">4. Do I need a callname? How do I choose one? </a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The answer is yes! Every <strong>TOKU</strong> user needs a callname to make and receive calls. </p>

<p>Your callname has to be a minimum of 3, to a maximum of 30 characters in length and should
only consist of alphabets, numbers and/or the underscore _ symbol. </p>

<p>Your callname is permanent and will be shared with people you want to receive web calls
from... so choose carefully!</p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion">5. What if the <strong>TOKU</strong> callname I want is taken?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>If your chosen callname is taken, you will have to choose another one, as all callnames are on
a first-come-first-served basis. </p>

<p>If you are a corporate or business user and your company callname is taken, <a href="contact-us.html">contact us</a>. </p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion alt">6. What is my personal <strong>TOKU</strong> web call link? How do I use it?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Your personal webcall link is attached to your callname. The URL to follow is:</p>

<p><a href="http://my.tokuapp.com/yourcallnamehere" target="_blank">http://my.tokuapp.com/yourcallnamehere</a></p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Anyone who accesses your <strong>TOKU</strong> webcall link can make a call to you right away – no
registration or lengthy authentication processes needed. So get sharing!</i></p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion">7. Do I need to share my e-mail with <strong>TOKU</strong>?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes. Your e-mail address is required from time to time to ensure that your account
details can be backed up, should you ever change or lose your phone number, so don’t take
too long to verify your e-mail address.</p>

<p>We do send the occasional e-mail containing important account updates, exclusive content
and special promotions that you can unsubscribe from at any time. Your data is safe and will
never be shared with any third parties. That’s our <strong>TOKU</strong> promise!</p>

        <h4 style="margin-bottom:20px; margin-top:40px;">Making calls</h4>
        <a href="#" class="accordion alt">8. How do I make a call with <strong>TOKU</strong>?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Easy. Open the app and navigate to the Contacts section. Click on the Phone Icon next to the
name of the person you’d like to call... and <strong>TOKU</strong> will get you connected.</p>

<p><strong>TOKU Recommends: Best Available Call Option</strong><br>
Depending on where you are, or who you are calling, our <strong>TOKU</strong>-tastic technology will provide
you with the best available call option, in realtime. </p>

<p><strong>Prefer a different call option? Not a problem.</strong></p>

<p>Just click on the horizontal ellipsis icon (it looks like three dots … ) located at the bottom right
of the screen. From there, you will be able to choose from the other call options available. </p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion">9. What are all the call options <strong>TOKU</strong> has?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>We have five <strong>TOKU</strong>-mazing call options at present:</p>

<p><span class="yellow">OPTION 1: FREE CALL</span><br>
<strong>How it works: Make a call over your internet or data connection.</strong></p>

<p>It’s free for a <strong>TOKU</strong> user (you) call another <strong>TOKU</strong> user (friend) over a stable internet connection. </p>

<p>To find out if your friend is already a <strong>TOKU</strong> user, click on the “Contacts” section, followed by the
“<strong>TOKU</strong>” tab. All contacts displayed there are fellow <strong>TOKU</strong> users that you can call for free.
Just click on their name and call away!</p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Free Call requires an Internet connection or Mobile Data. Any charges incurred for these services with your local Internet and/or Mobile Service Provider (MSP) will apply. </i></p>


<p><span class="yellow">OPTION 2: CALL OUT</span><br>
<strong>How it works: Make a call over your internet or data connection to a mobile or landline
number anywhere in the world - for one of the lowest call rates around.</strong></p>

<p>Call out lets you make calls to any number (both mobile and landline!) in any country
worldwide for a very affordable rate. </p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Call Out requires an Internet connection or Mobile Data. Any charges incurred for
these services with your local Internet and/or Mobile Service Provider (MSP) will apply.</i></p>


<p><span class="yellow">OPTION 3: CALL THRU (*Available in Singapore only)</span><br>
<strong>How it works: Make a local call from your mobile or landline to a local <strong>TOKU</strong> number and
get connected to any International Number of your choice. </strong></p>

<p>Call Thru allows you to make an International call to any mobile or landline without the
expensive international call charges. Just make a regular local call (mobile or landline) to the
<strong>TOKU</strong> local number provided, and we take care of the rest! </p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Call Thru is only available in Singapore at the moment, but we are wokring hard to roll this feature out to more countries. In SG? Your local outgoing voice call charges will apply.</i></p>


<p><span class="yellow">OPTION 4: CALL BACK</span><br>
<strong>How it works:  Make a request to call a contact and  <strong>TOKU</strong> calls you back once connected.</strong></p>

<p>If you choose the Call Back option next to a contact on the <strong>TOKU</strong> app, our clever servers
will call you back and connect you to the number attached to the contact requested.</p>

<p>No Internet connection for your app to work? Not a problem, TOKU can also send Call Back
requests to the TOKU servers via SMS. </p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Call Back requires incoming voice calls and your MSP voice call charges will apply.</i></p>


<p><span class="yellow">OPTION 5: NATIVE CALL</span><br>
<strong>How it works: This option exits <strong>TOKU</strong> and makes a standard call from your mobile.</strong></p>

<p>On the rare occasion that we have to go back to basics, <strong>TOKU</strong> will connect your call
outside of the app through the standard dialer pad on your mobile. </p>

<p><i><strong>Note:</strong> Native call requires outgoing calls and your MSP voice call charges will apply.</i></p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion alt">10. Can I try <strong>TOKU</strong> before deciding to purchase credit?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Sure you can. And your first call is on us! </p>

<p>When you sign up, you will automatically receive USD $0.20 to call the world. This will get you
about 3 to 15 minutes’ worth of talk time, depending on the country you’re calling.</p>

<p>Try us out. We can’t wait to impress you with our amazing call quality!</p>
        </div>

        <a href="#" class="accordion">11. Can I use <strong>TOKU</strong> when I am overseas?</a>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Yes you can! However, the relevant Internet or Data charges will apply, please check the
source of your internet connection or data roaming plan through your MSP (Mobile Service
Provider) prior to use. </p>

<p>If you are a Singapore user, <a href="call-rates.html">Call Thru</a> will incur roaming charges as set by your MSP.</p>
